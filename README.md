# CleanBot

CleanBot is a Discord bot used to send the weekly (house cleaning related) tasks in a discord server.

## About

I live in a student house and at one point a cleaning schedule was necessary. 

Now a simple paper won't do, so I created CleanBot to send a message in the discord every week to show who needs to clean what.  

## Todo

- Add Docker container
- Make the message look nicer (maybe webhooks)
- Let users checkoff tasks

## Dependencies

- python 3.13.3
  - discord.py 2.5.2
  - python-dotenv 1.1.0
